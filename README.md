-  myOrderingApp_v2.4  takes text file, and gives a list of the unique words within it ordered by the frequency of the words in the English language
-  a step here of getting the definition of the words (using ChatGPT is advised) chatGPT API is paid, so, could not use it. another method for future development would be adding the definition to the dataset.
-  add_definitions_to_srt  gets an srt file, together with the output of the previous step and adds the presumably difficult vocabulary definitions to it
